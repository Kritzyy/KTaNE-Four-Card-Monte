Ideas:

- Bank Account:
Calculate the value for the chip you pressed, 
then go through some other calculations to figure out what your prize is.
Lastly, deposit the money on the bank account.


- Casino rules:
Standard casino rules will apply.
You cannot leave the casino until you have solved all casino modules. (Poker, blackjack, etc.)
Also, you cannot enter/deal when the time isn't right.
